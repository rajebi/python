#==================== HashSets ============================
# Mathematically a set is a collection of items not in any particular order. 
# A Python set is similar to this mathematical definition with below additional conditions.
#   The elements in the set cannot be duplicates.
#   The elements in the set are immutable(cannot be modified) but the set as a whole is mutable.
#   There is no index attached to any element in a python set. So they do not support any indexing or slicing operation.

# The sets in python are typically used for mathematical operations like union, 
# intersection, difference and complement etc. We can create a set, access itâ€™s elements 
# and carry out these mathematical operations as shown below.

def set_examples():

#==================== Dictionary ==========================================
# In Dictionary each key is separated from its value by a colon (:), 
# the items are separated by commas, and the whole thing is enclosed in curly braces. 
# An empty dictionary without any items is written with just two curly braces, like this âˆ’ {}.
# Keys are unique within a dictionary while values may not be. The values of a dictionary 
# can be of any type, but the keys must be of an immutable data type such as strings, numbers, or tuples.

#================== Tuples =======================================
# A tuple is a sequence of immutable Python objects. 
# Tuples are sequences, just like lists. The differences between
